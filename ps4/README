This is a fresh copy of ps4 pulled directly from svn with these
scripts. No changes made to the files yet. They're included as an
example and because I don't want to bother renaming everything to be a
more anonymized example.

The main trick to this setup is svn must be a symbolic link to the ps4
directory in your svn repo. Everything else (should) work without any
tweaks.

================================================================

There are two major design changes from the previous version (in the
parent directory).

====

Pulling is closer to automated:

$ make genpull

will now find all the files in the svn repo, attempt to remove the
uninteresting ones (svn files, not actual code).

====

Pulling handles directory mirroring:

$ make pull

will now read out the directory tree in the svn repo and mirror it in
the current directory.

====

Pushing handles directory mirroring:

$ make push

will now push the directory tree in the current directory to the svn
repo.

====

NOTE: the directory trees mirrored in make pull and make push are NOT
handled in SVN-FILES yet. The entire tree, regardless of content or if
you want it to be copied, will be mirrored. The scripts should
correctly avoid .svn directories, but as is they don't think about
anything else. If you do your pset work in the top level of your git
repository, you may want to make it ignore your .git directory as
well. Poke around in push.sh to figure out how, it should be
clear. You can use pull.sh as an example for how to exclude
directories.

====

I've barely tested any of this, at the time of this writing I've only
used these scripts to pull the svn ps4 starting files and push a tmp
directory to see if that part worked. Please poke me (on github, or
any other way you can figure out) if you find any bugs.
