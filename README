I developed this toolchain while in 6.005 and slowly added features as
the class went on. The expected development environment 6.005 is aimed
at is Java in Eclipse working in an SVN repository. I prefer the
command line to Eclipse, make to ant, and git to svn. So I designed a
set of tools to allow me to pull starting files from SVN, work on them
in my oen environment and push them back.

I have not thought all edge cases of these scripts through carefully,
and I rely on knowing them inside and out to keep myself out of
trouble. I'm trying to clean the scripts up to be less specialized to
my computer and less dangerous. If I remember, I'll keep pushing my
changes to this repository as the semester goes on. There's a chance
I'll turn this into a .deb once it's polished enough, I hope to hand
it off to the 6.005 staff for future years.
