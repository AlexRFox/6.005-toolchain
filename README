This is a Makefile for 6.005 problem sets and projects. This Makefile allows you to work on 6.005 assignments using the command line and your favorite text editor without having to use Eclipse.

Copy the Makefile file to the top-level directory of your assignment to use it, or, run make from the to-level directory of this repository to try the example out.

To compile your code and run the unit tests, run the command:
   make
from the top-level directory of your assignment.

To run the main function, run the command:
   make main

To generate documentation, run the command:
   make docs
You can visit the generated documentation by pointing your browser to docs/index.html:
   google-chrome doc/index.html 

To generate a TAGS file for use with emacs/vim autocompletion:
   make TAGS

To cleanup generated files:
   make clean

This code was originally based on Alex Willison's 6.005 toolchain from Spring 2012.
